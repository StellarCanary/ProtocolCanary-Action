# Plan: Protocol-Canary 0.2.0 and this Action

Status: proposal for maintainer review. Nothing in this plan has been applied.
The Action's `version` default stays `0.1.1`, the floating `v1` tag is untouched,
and no Action release is proposed by this document.

## Why this needs a plan

Protocol-Canary 0.2.0 (prepared, not yet published) changes the outcome of
invocations that worked before:

- `check` exits `2` and prints no report when no fixture applies, instead of
  passing. `--allow-empty` restores the old exit code.
- Fixture directories containing symbolic links, junctions or unsafe payload
  paths are rejected (exit `4`).
- `.stellar-canary.toml` with an unknown section or key is rejected (exit `2`).
- `check` keeps a result cache in `.stellar-canary-cache/` and JSON results gain
  an optional `source` field.

Because `@v1` is a floating tag and `version` has a default, changing the default
engine silently switches every `@v1` user to this behavior. This plan avoids that.

## What was verified (2026-10-09)

Run locally, with this repository's `dist/index.js` at `def0e8a` and an engine
built from the 0.2.0 release-preparation branch, installed in a temporary
`CARGO_HOME` so the Action's "use the installed matching binary" path ran. No
network access beyond the Action's own GitHub API call, no credentials.

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| `version: 0.2.0`, Protocol 28 pack, offline config | job passes, `status=pass`, 4 checks passed, report path output set |
| `version: 0.2.0`, `protocol: 29` against the Protocol 28 pack | job fails as an execution failure; summary contains the engine's `no checks ran: ...` text |
| Same case, annotation text | reads "Canary configuration is invalid. (exit code 2)" and omits the engine's reason (tracked as an issue draft) |
| `version` input accepts `0.2.0` | yes, no Action change is needed to opt in |

Not verified: an install through `cargo install --git ... --tag v0.2.0`, because
the tag does not exist. That check belongs after publication.

## Proposed sequence

1. **Do nothing to defaults.** Users who want 0.2.0 set `version: 0.2.0`. Add a
   row to the compatibility table only after step 2 has passed.
2. **After the engine release is published,** run the Action from `main` with
   `version: 0.2.0` through `cargo install --git ... --tag v0.2.0 --locked`
   against the Fixtures `protocol-28` tag (offline job) in a scratch repository
   or a dispatched workflow. Record the run URL. Also run it with `0.1.1` to
   confirm nothing regressed.
3. **Small Action changes that make 0.2.0 usable** (separate pull requests, each
   tested with the mock engine): show the engine's reason in the failure
   annotation and fix the exit-2 description; an `allow-empty` input accepted
   only when the resolved engine is 0.2.0 or newer; display replayed-result
   counts.
4. **Decide the default separately.** Moving the default to 0.2.0 turns
   previously passing `@v1` runs into failures. Recommended: do it only in a new
   major tag (`v2`) with a migration note, leaving `v1` on `0.1.1`. This is a
   maintainer decision; it is not made here.
5. **Update the compatibility table** in the README and `docs/releases.md` with
   exactly the combinations that were run in step 2, and nothing else.

## Risks to watch

- The weekly `integration.yml` job has failed since Testnet moved to protocol 29
  (see the draft issue "Repair the weekly live integration workflow"). It will
  also fail for 0.2.0 against Protocol 28 identity fixtures. That is expected under
  decision D-09 and is not a reason to change engine behavior.
- Anyone running a "no fixtures" step on purpose (for example to test their
  workflow wiring) needs `--allow-empty`, which the Action cannot pass today.
- A checksum published beside an engine asset protects against corruption, not
  against a compromised release; this Action does not verify signatures because
  none exist.
